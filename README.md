Some visualization techniques on Divvy Bikeride Dataset 

Divvy Bikeride Dataset consits of latitude, longitude, when the ride started and ended, was the rider member or casual rider 

We start with understanding what kind of values are present in dataset and carry on to create visualization on it to understand 
1. How many rides per day
2. What day of time people preferred for riding a bike
3. No. of members who used bikes at given day
4. What kind of biked member preferred - classic_bike, docked_bike or electric bike
5. How member and non member count changes on weekday and weekend
